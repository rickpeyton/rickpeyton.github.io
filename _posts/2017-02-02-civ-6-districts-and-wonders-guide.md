Disclaimer: I did not create either of the included images. I just thought it would be handy to have them easily accessible on one domain.

## Wonder Rankings

### Update

I created another Wonders resource [to filter Civ 6 Wonders](https://www.civwonders.com/). This is primarily to help save land to build wonders on.

I have ranked all of the wonders in Tiers with 5 being the highest. And then sorted them by Era. Mostly for city planning.
