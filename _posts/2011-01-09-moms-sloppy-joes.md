This was always one of my favorite dinners growing up. I typically mix it up by adding a little more spice or brown mustard, but the basic template always applies.

The Ingredients

- Small can of tomato sauce
- 2lb lean ground beef
- 1.5c ketchup
- 2tsp mustard
- 2tsp pepper
- 2tsp Lawry’s
- 1tbsp dried onions
- 1 clove fresh garlic

The Steps

- Brown fresh garlic and dried onions in skillet in a touch of olive oil and add ground beef.
- Once beef is browned, stir in ketchup, mustard, pepper, Lawry’s and tomato sauce.
- Reduce heat and simmer for about 30 minutes.

Serve on hamburger buns or kaiser rolls.
