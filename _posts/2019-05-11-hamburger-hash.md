I donâ€™t remember my dad cooking many meals growing up, but when he did it was probably Hamburger Hash. Dad always made his in the microwave and it turned out great.
I made it for my boys recently and it was a hit with them too. Here is my variation.

Ingredients

- 2lb ground beef
- 1 large onion
- 2lb potatoes, cut into small chunks
- 1cup beef broth
- water to almost cover
- 2 tablespoons worcestershire
- 1 tablespoon cumin
- 2 cloves of garlic

Directions

- Brown the beef, garlic and onion with the worcestershire and cumin
- Add potatoes, broth and water
- Bring to boil
- Cover and simmer until the potatoes are soft (30 minutes)
- Drain off any excess water

Serve it topped with ketchup
