I love the combination of the onion soup mix and the cream of mushroom soup. I have not made this one in several years, but it is a recipe I do not want to lose.

The Ingredients

- 10.75oz can condensed cream of mushroom soup
- .5 package dry onion soup mix
- 3/4c water
- 3lb rump roast

The Steps

- Place roast in crock-pot
- Mix cream of mushroom soup, dry onion soup mix and water and pour over roast
- Cook on low 8 to 10 hours
